CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:15 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmrpt-slam.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "mrpt-slam", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mrpt-slam" with
  any of the following names:

    mrpt-slamConfig.cmake
    mrpt-slam-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mrpt-slam" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "mrpt-slam_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "mrpt-slam" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
